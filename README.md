### Resources Referenced
- [Java Quickstart for Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/java)
    - Because the Quickstart assumes you made a project using Gradle, but this project uses Ant, I ended up manually downloading and referencing most of the libraries used here, which are in the libraries folder
    - Main Google dependencies can be [downloaded here](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/google-api-java-client/download), and the rest of the smaller dependencies (like Gmail API) can be found searching the [Maven Central repository search](https://search.maven.org/) and downloading them
- [Efficient Java Development for the Raspberry Pi](https://www.instructables.com/Efficient-Development-of-Java-for-the-Raspberry-Pi/)
